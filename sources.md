> With respect to net neutrality and Title II. I encourage the commission to overturn Tom Wheeler's order to control the Internet. Internet users, rather than unelected bureaucrats, deserve to purchase whichever products we choose. Tom Wheeler's order to control the Internet is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It undid a pro-consumer framework that performed fabulously successfully for two decades with both parties' support.

> With respect to Internet regulation and net neutrality. I request the commission to reverse Obama's power grab to regulate broadband. Internet users, not the FCC Enforcement Bureau, deserve to use whatever services we choose. Obama's power grab to regulate broadband is a distortion of net neutrality. It stopped a light-touch approach that worked very well for many years with bipartisan backing.

> Dear Commissioners:  With respect to net neutrality. I want to encourage the FCC to repeal Obama's plan to control Internet access. Internet users, not big government, deserve to select whichever applications they want. Obama's plan to control Internet access is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It ended a hands-off system that performed supremely well for two decades with nearly universal consensus.

> The free-market Internet was an incredible engine of economic growth, innovation, and job creation since the 1990s and has already been substantially slowed by the 2015 Net Neutrality rules. The slowdown in investment is destroying jobs and risks a big future tax hike to make up for lost private investment. Save American jobs by repealing Net Neutrality

`bot.unprecedented`

`bot.outraged`

`form.tpa`

> Obama's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced regulations on the internet that put the government

`bot.best_cop`

> Restore privacy by repealing Net Neutrality

> The Title II order created a gaping gap in privacy protections by taking the best cop, the FTC, off the beat. That is reason enough to support Chairman Pai's proposal to restore Internet freedom. Restore privacy by repealing Net Neutrality.

`bot.economics_free_zone`

> own chief economist Tim Brennan called the rules

> The FCC's Net Neutrality rules were written in the Obama White House by political staff and Tech Industry special interests who overruled the FCC's own experts. The FCC's own chief economist Tim Brennan called the rules "an economics-free zone." They should be repealed.

`bot.corrupt_result`

> corrupt result of a corrupt process

> Obama's Net Neutrality order was the corrupt result of a corrupt process controlled by Silicon Valley special interests. It gives some of the biggest companies in the world a free ride at the expense of consumers and should be immediately repealed!

`form.dearfcc`

`bot.illogically-named`

`form.signforgood`

`form.freepress`

`bot.dissapear`

> make sure net neutrality does not dissapear

> make sure net neutrality does not dissapear. It is the only thing saving the internet at this moment. If it is removed many webservices will be at risk.

`bot.telecommunications_act`

> I am in favor of strong net neutrality under Title II of the Telecommunications Act

`bot.thenewsearchengine`

> small companies to compete with large online businesses up to the whims of our internet providers

> We should not leave the ability for small companies to compete with large online businesses up to the whims of our internet providers. It is our responsibility to defend our right to free market competition. IF THENEWSEARCHENGINE is better than Google, Google's wealth should not strike down the new engine if our internet providers choose not to be benevolent. Please save net neutrality. My job as a freelance artist counts on it and so does millions of others!

`bot.maga`

> mesmorized by money that it jeopardizes the well-being of its citizens. Is this how we MAGA

> Leave the net neutrality alone. Internet speed should not be for sale. There is nothing wrong with out current system save for the greedy corporations who wish to turn the internet into their own pay-to-play and a government willing to let them do it. You serve the American people not just Verizon, AT&T, etc. IF you think the current protests are bad, try touching new neutrality. I will never understand why a nation who has come so far is hell bent on going back to the 18th century. No other modern nation is so mesmorized by money that it jeopardizes the well-being of its citizens. Is this how we MAGA?
