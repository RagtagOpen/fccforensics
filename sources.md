`bot.recursive`

> With respect to net neutrality and Title II. I encourage the commission to overturn Tom Wheeler's order to control the Internet. Internet users, rather than unelected bureaucrats, deserve to purchase whichever products we choose. Tom Wheeler's order to control the Internet is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It undid a pro-consumer framework that performed fabulously successfully for two decades with both parties' support.

> With respect to Internet regulation and net neutrality. I request the commission to reverse Obama's power grab to regulate broadband. Internet users, not the FCC Enforcement Bureau, deserve to use whatever services we choose. Obama's power grab to regulate broadband is a distortion of net neutrality. It stopped a light-touch approach that worked very well for many years with bipartisan backing.

> Dear Commissioners:  With respect to net neutrality. I want to encourage the FCC to repeal Obama's plan to control Internet access. Internet users, not big government, deserve to select whichever applications they want. Obama's plan to control Internet access is a exploitation  of net neutrality. It ended a hands-off system that performed supremely well for two decades with nearly universal consensus.

`bot.american-jobs`

> The free-market Internet was an incredible engine of economic growth, innovation, and job creation since the 1990s and has already been substantially slowed by the 2015 Net Neutrality rules. The slowdown in investment is destroying jobs and risks a big future tax hike to make up for lost private investment. Save American jobs by repealing Net Neutrality

`bot.unprecedented`

> The unprecedented regulatory power the Obama Administration imposed on the internet

`bot.outraged`

`form.diminished-investment`

> Obama's Federal Communications Commission (FCC) forced regulations on the internet that put the government

> As a concerned taxpayer and consumer, I am writing to urge the FCC to set the internet free and remove the inappropriate, unnecessary and overly vast regulations currently holding back the full potential of the internet. Due to the grip of the utility-style regulations imposed under the previous Commission, taxpayers have been put at risk, the threat of new fees on consumer bills still looms large, investment in internet infrastructure has not realized its full potential, innovations have gone undeveloped and unrealized, and twenty years of the appropriate level of oversight of the internet has been reversed.
>
> We must dial-back the poorly conceived application of Title II in the Open Internet Order so that American taxpayers can benefit from an unrestrained and truly open internet that scales back the unlimited power of the government, protects consumers from new taxes and encourages future investment and endless innovations.

`bot.best_cop`

> Restore privacy by repealing Net Neutrality

> The Title II order created a gaping gap in privacy protections by taking the best cop, the FTC, off the beat. That is reason enough to support Chairman Pai's proposal to restore Internet freedom. Restore privacy by repealing Net Neutrality.

`bot.economics_free_zone`

> own chief economist Tim Brennan called the rules

> The FCC's Net Neutrality rules were written in the Obama White House by political staff and Tech Industry special interests who overruled the FCC's own experts. The FCC's own chief economist Tim Brennan called the rules "an economics-free zone." They should be repealed.

`bot.corrupt_result`

> corrupt result of a corrupt process

> Obama's Net Neutrality order was the corrupt result of a corrupt process controlled by Silicon Valley special interests. It gives some of the biggest companies in the world a free ride at the expense of consumers and should be immediately repealed!

> I am writing in regard to the Commission's work on preserving an open internet

> there is a right way and a wrong way to preserve the concept of an open internet

> While the internet has drastically changed over the years, our internet regulations remain outdated

> the open internet is compromised when partisan politics and regulatory uncertainty come into play

> work with each other to overturn the existing burdensome rules at the FCC and enact lasting legislation

> time for Congress to provide clear direction by passing legislation that provides certainty

> action to overturn the current law designed 80 years ago, before the Internet was created, is a great first step

> While the internet has drastically changed over the years, our internet regulations remain outdated

> I agree with the current FCC that heavy-handed regulations will do more harm than good

> work to get rid of the rules that were harming the internet economy

> urge you to work with your fellow members of Congress and the FCC to permanently preserve an open internet by supporting bipartisan legislation

> believe only legislation can ensure we have permanent, enforceable open internet rules

> Bipartisan legislation can help end the years-long political back-and-forth

> get rid of the rules that unfairly and heavy-handedly enforced these principles


`bot.telephone_monopoly`

> Title II is a Depression-era regulatory framework designed for a telephone monopoly that no longer exists. It was wrong to apply it to the Internet and the FCC should repeal it and go back to the free-market approach that worked so well.


`bot.titleii_takeover`

> Dear FCC Commissioner ,
> 
> The Obama-era FCC regulations known as ""Title II"" enable the federal government to exert an extraordinary and unnecessary amount of regulatory control over the internet. This bureaucratic overreach impedes innovation, stifles investment and continues to create economic uncertainty for one of the largest sectors of the U.S. economy.
> 
> I support Chairman Pai's proposal to roll back Title II and restore the sensible regulatory framework that enjoyed broad bipartisan consensus and enabled the internet to thrive for more than two decades.
> 
> I strongly urge all of the FCC Commissioners to support the Chairman's proposal to repeal the harmful Title II internet takeover.

`bot.telecommunications_act`

> I am in favor of strong net neutrality under Title II of the Telecommunications Act

`bot.thenewsearchengine`

> small companies to compete with large online businesses up to the whims of our internet providers

> We should not leave the ability for small companies to compete with large online businesses up to the whims of our internet providers. It is our responsibility to defend our right to free market competition. IF THENEWSEARCHENGINE is better than Google, Google's wealth should not strike down the new engine if our internet providers choose not to be benevolent. Please save net neutrality. My job as a freelance artist counts on it and so does millions of others!

`bot.maga`

> mesmorized by money that it jeopardizes the well-being of its citizens. Is this how we MAGA

> Leave the net neutrality alone. Internet speed should not be for sale. There is nothing wrong with out current system save for the greedy corporations who wish to turn the internet into their own pay-to-play and a government willing to let them do it. You serve the American people not just Verizon, AT&T, etc. IF you think the current protests are bad, try touching new neutrality. I will never understand why a nation who has come so far is hell bent on going back to the 18th century. No other modern nation is so mesmorized by money that it jeopardizes the well-being of its citizens. Is this how we MAGA?
